# New Release
if you are making a new release, increment the version key in the relevant package.json file, then manually trigger the Build Release action. This will create a new release with the new version number, and update the website with the new info aswell. It will only create new releases for packages that the version number has changed. (IE, their tag doesnt exist yet)
