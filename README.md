# OpenFlight-VRC

Creating an open source system to allow all kinds of avatars to fly. Uses Udon Sharp: https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp

You can try it out on the community lab world (This is also my test world, so some settings might be wacky or experimental. Once V1 is released this world will become more static): https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_e61cba97-a1a9-4c53-93d2-7bb77240a2e7

As of now, I do not recommend downloading this project for your world yet as the physics are still a work in progress. Everything is subject to change!

## Roadmap to V1 release

- Minor physics bugfixes
- Desktop support
- Prefab toggle buttons for ease of use

## Plans for the future

In no particular order:
- In-game "How to fly" reference image
- Additional flight systems
  - Winged (current system): Flap arms to fly, hold arms out to glide
  - Engine: Arms out to sides to propel forward with greater control, arms down in an A-Pose to stay stationary/fly slowly (iron-man style)
  - Creative (Desktop users): Minecraft-inspired Creative mode flight
- Avatar detection system to automatically grant flight to certain avatar bases (for example, winged flight to avali or engine flight to aeromorphs)
- Equippable props (such as mechanical wings) that permit flying
- Wing trails (while gliding)
