# OpenAvaliFlight-VRC

Creating an open source system to allow Avalis to fly. Uses Udon Sharp: https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp

This early on, there is no Avali detection system yet. Any avatar can fly here.

Also, you will need to hold both triggers to flap. This will also change in the future.

You can try it out on the community lab world (This is also my test world, so some settings might be wacky or experimental on Quest): https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_e61cba97-a1a9-4c53-93d2-7bb77240a2e7
