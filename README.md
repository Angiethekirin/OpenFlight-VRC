# OpenAvaliFlight-VRC

Creating an open source system to allow Avalis to fly. Uses Udon Sharp: https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp

You can try it out on the community lab world (This is also my test world, so some settings might be wacky or experimental on Quest): https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_e61cba97-a1a9-4c53-93d2-7bb77240a2e7
