# OpenFlight-VRC

Creating an open source system to allow all kinds of avatars to fly. Uses Udon Sharp: https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp

This early on, there is no Avatar detection system yet. Any avatar can flap to fly here. In the future, seperate assets will be usable for multiple flight methods: for example, if you're a species with wings, you can flap to fly, but a normal human can fly if they don wings and a rocket.

You can try it out on the community lab world (This is also my test world, so some settings might be wacky or experimental on Quest): https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_e61cba97-a1a9-4c53-93d2-7bb77240a2e7

## Plans for the future

- Prefab menus/toggles for ease of use
- Additional flight systems
  - Winged (current system): Flap arms to fly, hold arms out to glide
  - Engine: Arms out to sides to propel forward with greater control, arms down in an A-Pose to stay stationary/fly slowly (iron-man style)
- Avatar detection system to automatically grant flight to certain avatar bases (for example, winged flight to avali or engine flight to aeromorphs)
- Equippable objects that permit flying despite the player's avatar
