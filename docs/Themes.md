Using work derived from the [USharpVideo Project](https://github.com/MerlinVR/USharpVideo) from MerlinVR, OpenFlight has a built-in theme system that allows you to quickly change the look of the tablet. Doing so allows you to better match the tablet to your worlds design and theme, instead of being out of place. By default, OpenFlight comes with these default themes:
- test
- test
